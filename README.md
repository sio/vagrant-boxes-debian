# Upstream Debian Vagrant boxes with all package updates applied

Upstream boxes are updated very rarely and at most times many updates are
pending. Applying those updates once is beneficial for repeated CI runs using
Debian base boxes


## TODO

- TODO: check box size; why updated boxes 2x larger?
- TODO: configure CI to use these boxes
