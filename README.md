# Vagrant boxes for Debian with latest package updates

Upstream Vagrant [boxes][upstream-vagrant-boxes] for Debian are updated very
rarely, and sometimes remain broken for a long time.

In this repo I build vanilla Debian boxes from upstream [cloud images] which are
updated a lot more frequently and have never been in a broken state due to
better CI/CD process.

The resulting boxes are published at Vagrant Cloud as [potyarkin/debian…]
